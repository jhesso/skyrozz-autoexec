// Moves the low latency sleep on tick frames to happen after client simulation.
// Default: false
//
// <-> By default, the engine calculates the time between frames before it processes the client tick. This can lead to a situation where
// the player's position is from a delayed point in time, even though their inputs are more up-to-date. This command moves the function
// responsible for sleeping after the tick processing. This means that the sleep will be shorter because the tick processing will be
// included in the time delta, resulting in increased responsiveness of the game and a reduced amount of texture stuttering.
//
// <!> Works in conjunction with 'r_low_latency' enabled (NVIDIA Low Latency).
// <!> Should benefit from a frame per second limitation (capped 'fps_max').
// <i> Implemented with the scope of frametime consistency.
// <i> Due to its intended mechanism, it may induce roughness (non-smoothness) during the gameplay. Be advised! It should be tested on everyone's case-scenario.

// Controls the time the engine sleeps per frame when the game is not in focus.
// Default: 20
//
// <-> Usually, when tab out of CS2, the engine will sleep for a set amount of milliseconds (repeatedly) to reduce power and resource usage.
//
// <i> Higher value can reduce CPU load and save power but there will be frame rate drops when tabbing and sound distortions if 'snd_mute_losefocus 0'.
// <i> Decreases the frame rates and produces lag on any locally hosted servers when tabbing out.
// <i> A lower value (or disable value) is recommended for streaming and local hosts.
